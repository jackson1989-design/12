## ✅ You're Going to Push to GitHub - No Terminal Needed!

Follow these exact steps on your Chromebook:

---

## STEP 1: Create GitHub Repository (2 minutes)

1. Go to: **https://github.com/login** (or signup if you don't have account)

2. After login, go to: **https://github.com/new**

3. Fill out the form:
   - **Repository name:** `latimore-digital-portfolio`
   - **Description:** "Professional digital portfolio with AI-powered legacy planning tools"
   - **Public** (so GitHub Pages works for free)
   - ⚠️ **DO NOT check** "Add a README file"
   - ⚠️ **DO NOT** add .gitignore or license
   - Click **"Create repository"**

4. You'll see a page with setup instructions - **IGNORE THEM** (those are for terminal)

---

## STEP 2: Upload Your Portfolio (1 minute)

1. On the repository page you just created, look for the text:
   **"uploading an existing file"** (it's a blue link)
   
2. Click **"uploading an existing file"**

3. You'll see a page that says "Drag files here"

4. **Download these files first:**
   - `latimore-portfolio.html`
   - Rename it to **`index.html`** (in your Downloads folder)

5. **Drag `index.html`** into the GitHub upload box

6. Scroll down to "Commit changes" section
   - Leave the message as is: "Add files via upload"
   - Click **"Commit changes"** (green button)

---

## STEP 3: Enable GitHub Pages (1 minute)

1. Click the **"Settings"** tab at the top of your repository

2. In the left sidebar, scroll down and click **"Pages"**

3. Under "Source" section:
   - Click the dropdown that says "None"
   - Select **"main"** (or "master")
   - Leave folder as **"/ (root)"**
   - Click **"Save"**

4. Wait 1-2 minutes (GitHub is building your site)

5. **Refresh the page**

6. You'll see a green box that says:
   **"Your site is published at https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/latimore-digital-portfolio/"**

```
